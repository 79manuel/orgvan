Your master bedroom closet is more than just a place to store your clothing. It is the place from which all your amazing outfits are created. 

There are many ways to organize your closet. Most often you would read that tops should be together, bottoms together, jackets together. It makes sense - right? It makes it easier to choose an outfit when you know all the possible tops you can wear.

Many people offer more suggestions like - put your off-season clothing into storage. Again, it makes sense. Unfortunately, it really does not make things easy when you suddenly get a cold spell in later summer. 

Like everything, the way you organize your closet is really up to you. There are many options, and what matters is that you can find what you want when you need it.
