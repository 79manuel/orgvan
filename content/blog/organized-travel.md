Organized travel

There are so many places where I could begin my blogging - but what keeps coming up for me lately is travel. I have been on a number of different business trips recently and each trip has been so difference.

I have done several day trips by plane to various parts of BC. One day I may have to give a presentation. Another day might be a business meeting. And another day is a trip to visit a single customer.

I have also had a long business trip to Toronto that lasted nearly a week. Six days of packing to think about.

Packing for travel does have its challenges. But the challenges increase with the number of days you’ll be on the road and the number of different activities that are planned. Not to mention that the weather at your destination needs to be considered. 

Packing is definitely both an art and a science. I have seen it mastered by people. I have used a number of different strategies to make my packing better. I am aiming towards having everything I need, nothing I don’t need, and a light bag to travel with. These goals are more challenging than they seem. 

I have picked up a number of learnings over the years - and here is what I feel everyone should think about:

1. Plan Plan Plan - trips may have a certain amount of uncertainty in them. But you can still make decisions even with that uncertainty. Planning starts with a piece of paper. 
   1. I create a column for each day I’ll be gone. And then I think about what might likely happen during each day. If it’s a business trip - will I be at a conference walking around all day or will I be sitting in meetings? If it’s a vacation, does the trip involve daily sitting by the pool with the occasional jaunt to dinner or an excursion or two? Make note of the most likely scenario of each day.
   2. Make note of downtime that might be considered. What would you do in that downtime? Will you want to curl up with a book? Or wil you (realistically) hit the gym? What about sleeping? I find packing pyjamas has a big potential to be forgotten (and maybe you’re ok with that). 
2. Based on the most likely activity, what sort of outfits will each activity require? Shoes comfortable for walking and appropriate business attire? Will a day of meetings be in rooms that could get a little chilly and it would be worth considering a scarf? Starred to make notes of critical articles of clothing for each activity block. 
3. Based on what are considered essential items to pack, begin to build outfits around those pieces. I do find at this point I like to start working physically with the items in my closet. Start building the wardrobe for this trip.
4. Next comes the editing and the coordination. Do the pieces in your curated packing list coordinate in terms of colour and style? Is it possible that certain pieces could be reused? Would using a blazer in different ways give different outfits a finished look? If you chose a different outfit, could you reduce the number of shoes you need to pack? The goal at this stage. Is to optimize the items you are packing which might mean reducing the actual numbers of pieces.
5. Think about outerwear. If you are going to Paris in March, chances are you will need to have a waterproof and warm jacket, and possibly boots. And if you’re going to Mexico when it’s snowing in your city, then you can’t forget your flip flops which could be packed away in your summer storage. Either way - here you are thinking about jackets and shoes. SUnglasses are also worthy of considering as outer ware. 
6. With regard to your toiletries - if you travel enough, you should probably have a second set of toiletries that are always ready to go. Having a second set will save you time and energy because it will always be ready. However, if you don’t travel regularly, I would suggest thinking systematically about your grooming needs. You could even pull out each item in the order that you would use it and collect it in a single spot. Then work towards the items you use on your face such as cleansers, creams and makeup. Then think about your body such as soap, razors, and deodorant. Once all the pieces are in one spot - you can begin making a list of the things that perhaps you should purchase a travel size of.  Put those items on a list, and then return the large version of the product. In this category, i am also thinking about medicines that I may need.
7. Finally - thinking about technology. I have a second set of device chargers always in my suitcase. But again, if you are not traveling all the time, you need to put a little reminder for the day you’re leaving of the last things you want to pack. And no one is leaving home without their devices and chargers. I think that the majority of people are able to live with their cell phones to photograph their travels. Although shutterbugs are going to need to make space in their bags for their camera equipment. 

So that is basically it. Clothing for all your activities, including outerwear, the products needed for the downtime like the book, gym stuff, camera, or other activities, toiletries and technology necessities. 

Thinking in this way systematically allows you to consider the many potential scenarios, become realistic about what needs you will have because of these activities, and pack accordingly. The truly good news is that, almost anywhere we travel, if we have forgotten something truly essential, the odds are very good that we will be able to purchase that item at our destination.
