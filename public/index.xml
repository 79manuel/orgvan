      <description>When it comes to organizing the spaces in your home, your office, or your documents, it can be hard to know where to start. Your home is your sanctuary and it is important that your spaces, your belongings and your processes work for you. Life has many stresses that are sometimes associated with change - moving home, changing relationships, changing jobs and having children. These changes present challenges - including a need to get organized or reorganize.</description>

      <description>Organized travel has its challenges. What to pack requires planning and some guess work. And one formula does not fit all trips.
Recently, I have been on a number of different business trips and they have all been so different. I have done several day trips by plane to various parts of BC. One day I may have to give a presentation. Another day might be a client meeting. I also had a recent week long business trip.</description>

      <description>Your master bedroom closet is more than just a place to store your clothing. It is the place from which all your amazing outfits are created.
There are many ways to organize your closet. Most often you would hear that tops should be together, bottoms together, jackets together. It makes sense - right? It is easier to choose an outfit when you know all the possible tops you can wear.</description>
