            Most people appreciate an organized space. But not everyone wants to use their valuable time to create the
            spaces and systems necessary to achieve a space that has space for everything they need, and a map of where
            to find everything. You may feel that you have too much stuff in your home, or you may feel frustrated not
            knowing where to find things, or where to put things.
